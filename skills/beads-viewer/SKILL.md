# Beads Viewer

## Overview

Beads Viewer (BV) is a graph-aware triage engine for Beads projects (`.beads/beads.jsonl`). It computes 9 graph metrics, generates execution plans, and provides deterministic recommendations.

**When to use:** Triaging beads tasks, analyzing dependency graphs, finding bottlenecks, detecting circular dependencies, planning parallel execution tracks, generating sprint burndown data, comparing historical project states.

**When NOT to use:** Parsing raw `beads.jsonl` directly (BV pre-computes graph metrics), simple bead CRUD operations (use `bd` CLI instead), projects without `.beads/beads.jsonl`.

| Capability   | Raw beads.jsonl                | BV Robot Mode                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Query        | "List all issues"              | "List the top 5 bottlenecks blocking the release" |
| Context Cost | High (linear with issue count) | Low (fixed summary struct)                        |
| Graph Logic  | Agent must compute             | Pre-computed (PageRank, betweenness, cycles)      |
| Safety       | Agent might miss cycles        | Cycles explicitly flagged                         |

## Quick Reference

| Command                            | Purpose                             | Key Points                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `bv --robot-triage`                | Full triage with recommendations    | Start here; includes quick_wins and blockers  |
| `bv --robot-next`                  | Single top pick with claim command  | Minimal context cost                          |
| `bv --robot-plan`                  | Parallel execution tracks           | Faster than `--robot-insights`                |
| `bv --robot-insights`              | Full graph metrics (all 9)          | Check `status` field; expensive               |
| `bv --robot-priority`              | Priority misalignment detection     | Flags misprioritzed items                     |
| `bv --robot-alerts`                | Stale issues, blocking cascades     | Proactive health checks                       |
| `bv --robot-suggest`               | Hygiene: duplicates, missing deps   | Includes cycle break suggestions              |
| `bv --robot-graph`                 | Dependency graph export             | JSON, DOT, or Mermaid format                  |
| `bv --recipe <name> --robot-<cmd>` | Pre-filter before any robot command | Recipes: actionable, high-impact, bottlenecks |
| `bv --robot-triage --label <name>` | Scope to label subgraph             | Reduces noise for focused analysis            |

**CRITICAL:** Never run bare `bv` from an agent session. It launches an interactive TUI that blocks the session. Always use `--robot-*` flags.

## The 9 Graph Metrics

| Metric            | What It Measures                | Key Insight                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **PageRank**      | Recursive dependency importance | Foundational blockers         |
| **Betweenness**   | Shortest-path traffic           | Bottlenecks and bridges       |
| **HITS**          | Hub/Authority duality           | Epics vs utilities            |
| **Critical Path** | Longest dependency chain        | Keystones with zero slack     |
| **Eigenvector**   | Influence via neighbors         | Strategic dependencies        |
| **Degree**        | Direct connection counts        | Immediate blockers/blocked    |
| **Density**       | Edge-to-node ratio              | Project coupling health       |
| **Cycles**        | Circular dependencies           | Structural errors (must fix!) |
| **Topo Sort**     | Valid execution order           | Work queue foundation         |

Metrics compute in two phases: Phase 1 (degree, topo sort, density) is instant; Phase 2 (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector, cycles) has a 500ms timeout. Always check the `status` field in output.

## Built-in Recipes

| Recipe        | Purpose                            |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `default`     | All open issues sorted by priority |
| `actionable`  | Ready to work (no blockers)        |
| `high-impact` | Top PageRank scores                |
| `blocked`     | Waiting on dependencies            |
| `stale`       | Open but untouched for 30+ days    |
| `triage`      | Sorted by computed triage score    |
| `quick-wins`  | Easy P2/P3 items with no blockers  |
| `bottlenecks` | High betweenness nodes             |

## Robot Output Structure

All robot JSON output includes these standard fields:

| Field                    | Purpose                                                         |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `data_hash`              | Fingerprint of beads.jsonl for verifying consistency            |
| `status`                 | Per-metric state: `computed`, `approx`, `timeout`, or `skipped` |
| `as_of` / `as_of_commit` | Present when using `--as-of` for time travel queries            |

Key output sections by command:

- **--robot-triage**: `quick_ref`, `recommendations`, `quick_wins`, `blockers_to_clear`, `project_health`, `commands`
- **--robot-insights**: `bottlenecks`, `keystones`, `influencers`, `hubs`, `authorities`, `cycles`, `clusterDensity`
- **--robot-plan**: `plan.tracks` (parallel work streams), `plan.summary.highest_impact`

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                                    | Correct Pattern                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Running bare `bv` from an agent session                    | Always use `--robot-*` flags; bare `bv` launches an interactive TUI that blocks the agent                              |
| Ignoring the `status` field in robot output                | Always check per-metric status; large graphs may have `approx` or `skipped` metrics due to 500ms timeout               |
| Using `--robot-insights` when only the next task is needed | Use `--robot-next` for a single top pick or `--robot-triage` for quick recommendations; insights is expensive          |
| Not checking for cycles before starting implementation     | Run `bv --robot-insights` and check `.cycles` first; circular dependencies are structural errors that must be resolved |
| Parsing stderr as JSON data                                | Only stdout contains JSON; diagnostics and warnings go to stderr                                                       |
| Stale metrics after bead changes                           | Check `data_hash` field; results are cached by beads.jsonl fingerprint                                                 |
| Wrong recommendations for current work                     | Use `--recipe actionable` to filter to only unblocked, ready-to-work items                                             |

## Delegation

- **Analyze project dependency health and bottlenecks**: Use `Task` agent to run BV robot commands and summarize graph metrics
- **Plan sprint work from triage output**: Use `Plan` agent to interpret triage recommendations and build execution tracks
- **Search for related beads context**: Use `Explore` agent to investigate bead descriptions and find implementation patterns

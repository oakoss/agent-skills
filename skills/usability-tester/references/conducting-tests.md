# Conducting Tests

## Think-Aloud Protocol

Key instruction to participant:

```text
"Please think aloud as you work. Tell me what you're looking for,
what you're thinking, what you're trying to do. There are no
wrong answers - we're testing the product, not you."
```

What to listen for:

- "I'm looking for..." (what they expect)
- "I thought this would..." (mental models)
- "This is confusing because..." (friction points)
- "I'm not sure if..." (uncertainty)

## Facilitation Rules

**Do:**

- Observe silently
- Take notes
- Let them struggle (reveals issues)
- Ask follow-up questions AFTER task
- Stay neutral

**Don't:**

- Help or explain
- Lead them ("maybe try clicking...")
- Defend design choices
- Interrupt during task
- Show frustration

## Questions to Ask After Each Task

```yaml
Completion Questions:
  - 'On a scale of 1-5, how easy was that task?'
  - 'What were you expecting to see?'
  - 'What was confusing about that?'
  - 'If you could change one thing, what would it be?'

Discovery Questions:
  - 'Where did you expect to find that?'
  - 'What do you think this [feature] does?'
  - 'Why did you click there?'
```

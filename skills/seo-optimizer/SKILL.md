| Ignoring Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, INP) impact on rankings         | Implement performance-first design and monitor vitals continuously            |
| Using hidden or incomplete JSON-LD schema markup                    | Define explicit, complete structured data that maps entities clearly          |
| Building thin affiliate pages without topical depth                 | Create pillar pages with comprehensive cluster coverage                       |
| Writing definitions longer than 60 words for snippet targeting      | Keep definition paragraphs to 40-60 words for featured snippet eligibility    |

## Delegation

- **Audit a site for technical SEO issues, missing schema, and Core Web Vitals problems**: Use `Explore` agent to crawl pages and identify structured data gaps
- **Implement JSON-LD schema markup and meta tags across page templates**: Use `Task` agent to add Organization, Article, FAQ, and Breadcrumb schemas
- **Plan a topical authority strategy with pillar pages and content clusters**: Use `Plan` agent to map keyword intent, cluster hierarchy, and internal linking architecture

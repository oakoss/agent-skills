# Expert Instruction

## Overview

Foundational meta-skill that defines behavioral and cognitive standards for senior AI engineering agents. Establishes the reasoning pipeline, memory architecture, and context engineering practices that enable autonomous, long-horizon task execution with verifiable outcomes.

**When to use:** Configuring agent reasoning, managing context windows, establishing verification protocols, orchestrating multi-agent workflows, optimizing token usage.

**When NOT to use:** Domain-specific coding tasks (use specialized skills), UI/UX design, database schema work.

## Quick Reference

| Pattern                | Approach                                      | Key Points                                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Perception             | Analyze terminal output, codebase, traces     | High-fidelity input ingestion                  |
| Hypothesis             | Generate multiple solution paths              | Evaluate before committing                     |
| Simulation             | Reason through change consequences            | Predict side effects                           |
| Action                 | Precise tool execution                        | Atomic, testable commits                       |
| Criticism              | Self-audit output                             | Check for bugs and style violations            |
| Context discovery      | Map framework versions and patterns           | Always discover before implementing            |
| Dependency audit       | Check existing tools before adding new ones   | Avoid unnecessary dependencies                 |
| Verifiable planning    | Define Definition of Done                     | Test pass, build success, or user approval     |
| Interactive alignment  | Ask the user for ambiguous requirements       | Confirm critical architectural decisions       |
| Atomic implementation  | Apply changes in logical, testable units      | Each commit should be independently verifiable |
| Audit and cleanup      | Run linter, remove debug artifacts            | No temporary code in final output              |
| Selective reading      | Use offset and limit parameters               | Avoid reading entire large files               |
| Symbol search          | Use grep/rg to find definitions               | Do not read entire directories                 |
| Few-shot anchoring     | Provide canonical examples                    | More effective than long rule lists            |
| Memory tiering         | Short-term, mid-term, long-term               | Match persistence to information lifetime      |
| Context packing        | Bundle related files                          | Structured markdown artifacts                  |
| Noise reduction        | Exclude node_modules, dist, binary artifacts  | Maximize signal-to-noise ratio in context      |
| Semantic summarization | Condense long logs into actionable facts      | Single-sentence failure descriptions           |
| Cognitive load pruning | Remove irrelevant history from active context | Free tokens for current task reasoning         |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                                | Correct Pattern                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Failing silently when a tool call or build step errors | Always report status and errors explicitly to the user                            |
| Inventing APIs or methods that do not exist            | Search documentation or use web search to verify API signatures before using them |
| Writing verbose explanations instead of showing code   | Prioritize code-first communication; explain only when asked                      |
| Ignoring surrounding code style and conventions        | Mimic the existing codebase patterns, naming, and formatting                      |
| Hardcoding secrets or API keys in source files         | Use environment variables and `.env` file mapping                                 |
| Reading entire directories to find a single symbol     | Use grep or rg to locate definitions, then read only relevant sections            |
| Skipping verification after implementation             | Every task must have a verification signal before marking complete                |
| Storing sensitive data in memory or context files      | Run a secret scrub before persisting any memory vector                            |
| Loading full file contents into context unnecessarily  | Use partial reads with offset and limit for large files                           |
| Including duplicate information from multiple sources  | Deduplicate context to preserve token budget                                      |

## Delegation

- **Explore a codebase to map framework versions and active patterns**: Use `Explore` agent
- **Execute a complex multi-step implementation with atomic commits**: Use `Task` agent
- **Plan architecture for a long-horizon feature with dependency analysis**: Use `Plan` agent

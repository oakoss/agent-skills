# Writing Patterns

## Sentence Variation

AI-generated prose tends toward uniform sentence length and structure. Human writing alternates between short, medium, and long sentences to create rhythm and emphasis.

### Length Variation

Mix sentence lengths deliberately. Short sentences create impact. Longer sentences provide nuance and connect related ideas through subordinate clauses. A paragraph that alternates between the two reads naturally.

```text
Before (AI-typical uniform length):
The platform provides comprehensive analytics for tracking user engagement.
It offers detailed reporting capabilities that help teams understand behavior.
The dashboard displays real-time metrics that update automatically every minute.
Teams can customize their views to focus on the metrics that matter most.

After (varied length):
The platform tracks user engagement through real-time analytics. Every metric updates by the minute. Teams customize their dashboards to surface what matters, whether that's conversion funnels, session duration, or feature adoption rates across segments. The reporting goes deep.
```

### Structure Variation

Alternate between simple, compound, and complex sentence structures. Avoid starting consecutive sentences with the same pattern.

```text
Before (repetitive "This/It" openings):
This feature allows users to export data in multiple formats.
It supports CSV, JSON, and PDF exports.
This makes it easy to share reports with stakeholders.
It also integrates with popular spreadsheet applications.

After (varied openings):
Users export data in CSV, JSON, or PDF. Sharing reports with stakeholders takes one click. The export system plugs directly into popular spreadsheet applications, so teams work with familiar tools instead of learning a new interface.
```

### The Fragment Technique

Intentional sentence fragments add punch when used sparingly. They break the mechanical feel of grammatically perfect AI output.

```text
Before:
The migration was completed successfully without any downtime.

After:
The migration completed without downtime. Zero disruption.
```

## Active Voice

Passive voice distances the reader from the action. Active voice clarifies who does what and reads more directly.

### Conversion Patterns

```text
Passive: The report was generated by the analytics team.
Active: The analytics team generated the report.

Passive: User data is processed and stored in encrypted databases.
Active: The system encrypts and stores user data.

Passive: The decision was made to deprecate the legacy API.
Active: We deprecated the legacy API.
```

### When Passive Voice Works

Passive voice serves a purpose when the actor is unknown, irrelevant, or deliberately de-emphasized.

```text
Appropriate passive: The vulnerability was patched in version 3.2.
(Focus is on the fix, not who wrote it.)

Appropriate passive: Three accounts were compromised during the incident.
(Focus is on the impact, not the attacker.)
```

Aim for 80-90% active voice in marketing and blog content. Technical documentation tolerates slightly more passive voice when processes matter more than actors.

## Concrete Language

AI defaults to abstract, qualitative claims. Human writers use specifics that readers can verify or picture.

### Replace Abstractions with Specifics

```text
Before: The tool significantly improves workflow efficiency.
After: The tool cut our deployment time from 45 minutes to 8.

Before: Many users have reported positive experiences.
After: 2,400 teams shipped with it last quarter.

Before: The platform offers robust security features.
After: The platform encrypts data at rest with AES-256 and enforces MFA for all admin accounts.
```

### Quantify When Possible

```text
Before: The response time is very fast.
After: The median response time is 12ms.

Before: A large number of customers use this feature.
After: 73% of paid accounts enable this feature within their first week.
```

### Use Sensory and Spatial Language

```text
Before: The onboarding experience is intuitive and user-friendly.
After: New users see their first dashboard within 90 seconds of signing up. Three fields, one click, done.
```

## Rhythm and Flow

### Paragraph Rhythm

Vary paragraph length. A one-sentence paragraph commands attention. A three-to-four sentence paragraph develops an idea. Alternating between the two creates a reading experience that feels deliberate rather than mechanical.

```text
Before (uniform paragraphs):
Our API handles authentication through OAuth 2.0 tokens. Each request must include a valid bearer token in the Authorization header. Tokens expire after 24 hours and must be refreshed using the refresh token endpoint.

Rate limiting protects the API from abuse. Each account receives 1,000 requests per minute by default. Enterprise accounts can request higher limits through the settings dashboard.

After (varied paragraphs):
Authentication runs on OAuth 2.0. Include a bearer token in every request's Authorization header; tokens last 24 hours before requiring a refresh.

Rate limits keep the API stable.

Each account gets 1,000 requests per minute. Enterprise teams that need more can raise their ceiling from the settings dashboard without filing a support ticket.
```

### Transitions That Connect Ideas

AI relies on generic transitional phrases ("Furthermore," "Additionally," "Moreover"). Human writers connect ideas by referencing the previous thought directly.

```text
Before: The search feature uses full-text indexing. Additionally, it supports fuzzy matching for typo tolerance. Furthermore, results are ranked by relevance.

After: The search feature uses full-text indexing. Typos don't break it thanks to built-in fuzzy matching, and results come back ranked by relevance rather than insertion order.
```

### Punctuation as Rhythm Tool

Vary punctuation to control pacing. Semicolons connect related thoughts; colons introduce specifics. Dashes create pauses for emphasis. Periods end ideas with finality.

```text
Before: The system supports multiple languages. It currently handles English, Spanish, French, German, and Japanese. More languages will be added in future releases.

After: The system handles five languages today: English, Spanish, French, German, and Japanese. More are coming, but those five cover 89% of our user base.
```

## The Read-Aloud Test

The most reliable humanization check is reading the content aloud. Flag anything that:

- Sounds like a press release rather than a conversation
- Contains phrases you would never say to a colleague
- Creates a monotonous drone when spoken
- Forces you to take a breath mid-sentence because the clause structure is too nested

If a sentence feels awkward when spoken, rewrite it until it flows naturally. Human writing mirrors natural speech patterns, even in formal contexts.

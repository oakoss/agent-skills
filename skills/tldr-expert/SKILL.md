# TLDR Expert

## Overview

Achieves high-fidelity codebase comprehension at a fraction of the token cost through semantic layers, structured digests, and advanced context packaging. Combines Repomix for context packing, Gitingest for repository digests, and llm-tldr for graph-based code analysis.

**When to use:** Reducing prompt overhead for large codebases, onboarding to unfamiliar repositories, mapping cross-file dependencies, creating AI-optimized context bundles.

**When NOT to use:** Small single-file tasks, final implementation debugging (read the full file), real-time code editing.

## Quick Reference

| Pattern            | Tool / Command                          | Key Points                                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Context packing    | `repomix --include "src/**" --compress` | Package subdirectories into AI-optimized bundles       |
| Signatures only    | `repomix --include "src/**" --compress` | Compression extracts signatures via Tree-sitter        |
| Repository digest  | `gitingest . -o digest.txt`             | Prompt-friendly summary for quick onboarding           |
| Dependency context | `tldr context funcName --project .`     | LLM-ready context for a function with 95% token saving |
| Caller tracing     | `tldr impact functionName .`            | Reverse call graph to assess change blast radius       |
| Forward call graph | `tldr calls .`                          | Build forward call graph across the project            |
| Semantic search    | `tldr semantic "session expiry" .`      | Find logic by meaning when naming is inconsistent      |
| Architecture audit | `tldr arch .`                           | Detect circular deps, layer violations, dead code      |
| Dead code finder   | `tldr dead .`                           | Find unreachable functions with zero callers           |
| File extraction    | `tldr extract src/file.ts`              | Extract AST (functions, classes, imports) from a file  |
| Secret scanning    | Repomix built-in secretlint             | Ensure context bundles contain no keys or PII          |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                                     | Correct Pattern                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Reading entire large files without checking structure first | Run `tldr extract` to get signatures before reading full files                 |
| Using `grep` for dependency tracing across files            | Use `tldr impact` for reverse call graph that understands dynamic imports      |
| Packing `node_modules` or `dist` into context bundles       | Configure Repomix ignore-list to exclude generated and vendor directories      |
| Assuming semantic search results are exhaustive             | Verify top matches against actual source and cross-reference with `rg`         |
| Running Repomix without compression on large directories    | Use `--compress` flag to stay within context window limits                     |
| Including irrelevant context that dilutes signal quality    | Follow top-down priority: index, signatures, core logic, then adjacent context |

## Delegation

- **Repository structure discovery**: Use `Explore` agent to map directory layout and identify key modules before building context bundles
- **Multi-step context packing workflow**: Use `Task` agent to run Gitingest digest, Repomix compression, and llm-tldr indexing in sequence
- **Architecture analysis and planning**: Use `Plan` agent to design context engineering strategy for large monorepos

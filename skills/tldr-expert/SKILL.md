# TL;DR Expert

## Overview

The TL;DR Expert skill produces clear, concise summaries of technical content. It applies structured patterns to distill complex information into actionable briefs at the right level of detail for the audience.

**When to use:** Writing PR descriptions, summarizing code changes for reviewers, creating executive briefs for stakeholders, distilling long discussions into decisions and action items, or generating release notes.

**When NOT to use:** Writing comprehensive documentation (use the `docs` skill), producing marketing copy, creating detailed tutorials, or writing specifications that require exhaustive coverage.

## Quick Reference

| Pattern           | Format                                           | Key Points                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Executive summary | Conclusion first, then evidence, then details    | Lead with the recommendation; inverted pyramid |
| PR description    | What changed, why, how to test                   | Reviewers read the title and first paragraph   |
| Code change       | Files changed, key decisions, impact areas       | Focus on intent, not line-by-line diff         |
| Meeting notes     | Decisions, action items, open questions          | Skip discussion; capture outcomes              |
| Release notes     | User-facing changes, breaking changes, migration | Write for users, not developers                |
| Technical brief   | Problem, solution, alternatives, recommendation  | One page max; link to details                  |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                   | Correct Pattern                                             |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Too verbose; includes every detail        | Cut to 20% of original length while keeping 80% of value    |
| Missing context; assumes reader knows     | Include one sentence of background before the summary       |
| Burying the lead in the third paragraph   | First sentence states the conclusion or key change          |
| No actionable items in meeting notes      | Every meeting summary ends with owners and deadlines        |
| Summarizing HOW instead of WHY            | Lead with intent and impact, not implementation details     |
| No audience awareness                     | Adjust depth: exec = 3 bullets, dev = 1 paragraph           |
| Release notes written for developers      | Focus on what users can do differently, not code changes    |
| PR description says "various fixes"       | List each change with a reason; vague helps no one          |
| Missing breaking changes in release notes | Breaking changes get their own section with migration steps |
| Using jargon for non-technical audience   | Match vocabulary to the reader's expertise level            |

## Delegation

- **Content discovery**: Use `Explore` agent to gather source material
- **Detailed review**: Use `Task` agent for thorough analysis before summarizing
- **Code review**: Delegate to `code-reviewer` agent for change impact assessment

> If the `docs` skill is available, delegate comprehensive documentation tasks to it.

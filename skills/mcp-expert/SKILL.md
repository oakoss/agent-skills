# MCP Expert

## Overview

Definitive resource for building and managing Model Context Protocol ecosystems. Covers the full lifecycle from server development and transport configuration to security, elicitation, and async task execution. Designs agent-first tool interfaces that minimize token usage and maximize LLM accuracy.

**When to use:** Building MCP servers, designing tool interfaces, configuring transports (Stdio/Streamable HTTP), implementing OAuth 2.1, troubleshooting connectivity, using elicitation for server-initiated user interaction.

**When NOT to use:** Application-level business logic, non-MCP API design, frontend UI components, general HTTP API development unrelated to MCP.

## Quick Reference

| Pattern                | API/Approach                             | Key Points                                       |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Outcome-oriented tools | Single-call operations                   | Avoid chatty multi-step APIs                     |
| Argument flattening    | Flat Zod schemas with descriptions       | Reduce model hallucination                       |
| Progressive disclosure | Return `mcp://` URIs for large data      | Agent reads partially via `resources/read`       |
| Retryable tools        | Return `retry_with` suggestions          | Help LLM self-correct on bad inputs              |
| Helpful errors         | Descriptive strings with fix guidance    | Never return raw exceptions or stack traces      |
| Pagination             | `has_more` + `next_cursor` metadata      | 20-50 records per call maximum                   |
| Structured outputs     | JSON Schema in `outputSchema`            | Typed tool results for programmatic consumption  |
| Stdio transport        | Local tools, stderr-only logging         | Never write to stdout except JSON-RPC            |
| Streamable HTTP        | Remote/cloud tools, single endpoint      | Replaces deprecated SSE transport                |
| OAuth 2.1 with PKCE    | Enterprise data access                   | MCP server is resource server, not auth server   |
| Elicitation            | Server-initiated user input              | Flat schema maps to forms, three response states |
| Async tasks            | `tasks/get`, `tasks/cancel`              | Long-running operations return task handles      |
| Capability scopes      | `read:docs`, `write:code`, `admin:users` | Granular permission boundaries                   |
| HITL gate              | `confirmation_required` flag             | Manual approval for destructive actions          |
| URL elicitation        | Secure credential collection             | Redirects user to browser for sensitive input    |
| Extensions             | Namespaced capability negotiation        | Optional features without forking the spec       |
| Sampling with tools    | Server-initiated LLM requests            | Enables server-side agent loops                  |

## Spec Versions

The current MCP specification is **2025-11-25**. Key milestones:

- **2025-03-26**: Streamable HTTP transport (deprecated standalone SSE), tool annotations
- **2025-06-18**: Structured tool outputs, elicitation, OAuth auth server separation
- **2025-11-25**: Async tasks, extensions framework, sampling with tools, CIMD auth, server discovery

## Onboarding Protocol

When an agent needs a new capability:

1. **Validation**: Check if the required MCP server is already active
2. **Guide**: If missing, provide the user with a direct installation path
3. **Config**: Use `uvx` or `npx` for zero-install execution where possible

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                              | Correct Pattern                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Designing chatty APIs requiring many round-trips     | Build outcome-oriented tools that accomplish tasks in a single call         |
| Logging to stdout breaking the Stdio transport       | Log only to stderr to keep the transport channel clean                      |
| Returning raw exceptions and stack traces to the LLM | Return helpful error strings with suggested corrections                     |
| Building monolithic servers with dozens of tools     | Keep servers focused with 5-15 tools for discoverability and maintenance    |
| Using deprecated HTTP+SSE transport for new servers  | Use Streamable HTTP for remote servers (single endpoint, optional SSE)      |
| Hardcoding secrets in MCP server configuration       | Use environment variable mapping for all sensitive values                   |
| Returning large datasets in a single tool call       | Use pagination (20-50 records) or resource URIs for large data              |
| Implementing auth server inside MCP server           | MCP server acts as OAuth 2.1 resource server only, delegate auth externally |
| Vague tool descriptions causing LLM hallucination    | Add example usage and strict constraints to the tool description field      |
| Synchronous blocking on long operations              | Return async task handles for operations exceeding timeout thresholds       |
| Passing received tokens to upstream APIs             | Validate tokens locally; never forward to avoid confused deputy attacks     |
| Requesting secrets through elicitation               | Use URL mode elicitation or dedicated OAuth flows for credential collection |

## MCP Primitives

MCP servers expose three core primitive types to clients:

- **Tools**: Model-controlled actions the LLM invokes to accomplish tasks (function calling)
- **Resources**: Application-controlled data exposed via `mcp://` URIs that clients read on demand
- **Prompts**: User-controlled templates that provide structured context for specific workflows

Servers declare which primitives they support during capability negotiation in the `initialize` handshake. The November 2025 spec adds **Tasks** as an experimental primitive for async execution.

## Transport Selection

| Scenario             | Transport       | Notes                                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Local CLI tools      | Stdio           | Fastest startup, no network overhead                    |
| Remote/cloud servers | Streamable HTTP | Single endpoint, optional SSE streaming                 |
| Legacy remote        | HTTP+SSE        | Deprecated since 2025-03-26, migrate to Streamable HTTP |

Clients should support Stdio whenever possible. Streamable HTTP supports both stateless and stateful server implementations via optional `Mcp-Session-Id` headers.

## Delegation

- **Discover and audit existing MCP server configurations**: Use `Explore` agent to check active servers, verify connectivity, and identify missing capabilities
- **Build and deploy a new MCP server with validation and auth**: Use `Task` agent to scaffold the server, implement Zod validation, and configure OAuth
- **Design MCP ecosystem architecture for multi-agent workflows**: Use `Plan` agent to map tool boundaries, transport selection, and security scoping

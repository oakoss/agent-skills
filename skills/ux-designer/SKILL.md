# UX Designer

## Overview

Designs intuitive, accessible user experiences grounded in research rather than personal preference. Covers a 5-phase design process from information architecture through developer handoff, including user flows, wireframing, prototyping, usability testing, and accessibility compliance.

**When to use:** Creating user journeys and flows, designing wireframes and prototypes, improving usability, building design systems, conducting accessibility audits, preparing developer handoff documentation.

**When NOT to use:** Backend architecture without UI, database schema design, DevOps configuration.

## Quick Reference

| Phase                    | Goal                                   | Key Deliverables                                    |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Information Architecture | Organize content and functionality     | Site map, navigation design, labeling taxonomy      |
| User Flows               | Map paths users take to complete tasks | Flow diagrams, happy path, error states, edge cases |
| Wireframing              | Create low-fidelity layouts            | Lo-fi/mid-fi/hi-fi wireframes, layout patterns      |
| Prototyping and Testing  | Create interactive prototypes and test | Clickable prototype, usability test results         |
| UI Design and Handoff    | Production-ready designs               | Design specs, component states, responsive layouts  |

## Key UX Principles

1. **Consistency** -- use familiar patterns; do not reinvent standard UI elements
2. **Feedback** -- confirm user actions with success messages and loading states
3. **Error Prevention** -- design to prevent errors, not just handle them
4. **Recognition Over Recall** -- show options rather than requiring memory
5. **Flexibility** -- support both novice and expert users with shortcuts and defaults

## Design Patterns Summary

| Pattern        | Key Rules                                                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Forms          | Label above field, inline validation, one column, group related fields |
| Navigation     | Current page highlighted, breadcrumbs for depth, max 7 top nav items   |
| Empty States   | Explain why empty, provide clear next action, use illustration or icon |
| Loading States | Skeleton screens over spinners, progress indicators, optimistic UI     |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                                         | Correct Pattern                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Designing based on personal preference instead of user research | Ground every design decision in user research, card sorting, or usability test data    |
| Skipping empty, loading, and error state designs                | Design all states for every screen: default, loading, empty, error, and success        |
| Using placeholder text as form labels                           | Place labels above fields; placeholders disappear on input and fail accessibility      |
| Ignoring keyboard navigation and focus states                   | Test Tab order, visible focus indicators, and ARIA labels for all interactive elements |
| Designing a single layout for all screen sizes                  | Create separate responsive layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints         |
| Not testing with real users before development                  | Conduct usability testing with 5+ participants on interactive prototypes               |

## Delegation

- **User research and testing**: Use `Task` agent to plan card sorting, tree testing, and usability test sessions
- **Accessibility audit**: Use `Explore` agent to verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all screens using automated tools
- **Design system architecture**: Use `Plan` agent to define color scales, typography hierarchy, spacing grid, and component library structure

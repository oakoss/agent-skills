# Utility Pro

## Overview

Masters the command-line environment by turning raw text and unstructured data into actionable insights. Combines Rust-powered search tools (ripgrep, fd, bat), structured data shells (Nushell), JSON manipulation (jq/yq), and modern HTTP clients (xh) for high-performance CLI workflows.

**Core philosophy:** Replace legacy text-parsing pipelines (grep/awk/sed chains) with purpose-built tools that understand structure. ripgrep understands gitignore rules, fd understands file types, jq understands JSON, and Nushell understands tables.

**When to use:** Codebase-wide search and analysis, multi-file refactoring, JSON/YAML transformation pipelines, API debugging, directory navigation, log parsing, disk usage auditing, dependency tracing.

**When NOT to use:** GUI-based tasks, complex application logic (write a script instead), tasks requiring interactive prompts.

## Tool Landscape

| Category         | Modern Tool    | Replaces              | Key Advantage                            |
| ---------------- | -------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Text search      | ripgrep (`rg`) | grep, ag, git grep    | Speed, `.gitignore` awareness, Unicode   |
| File search      | fd             | find                  | Smart defaults, regex, parallelism       |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                               | Correct Pattern                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Using `grep` instead of `ripgrep` for codebase search | Use `rg` which is 10-100x faster and respects `.gitignore` by default              |
| Piping `ls` output into `grep` for file filtering     | Use `fd` for file discovery, or `eza -D` / `eza --ignore-glob` for listing         |
| Writing complex `awk` scripts for structured data     | Use Nushell or `jq` which natively understand JSON, CSV, and YAML                  |
| Running `rm -rf` in scripts without a dry-run step    | Always add a verification or dry-run step before destructive operations            |
| Using capturing groups in regex when not needed       | Prefer non-capturing groups `(?:...)` for better performance in large-scale scans  |
| Searching `node_modules` or `.git` directories        | Use `rg` which skips these by default, or configure exclusions explicitly          |
| Forgetting `select(.type == "match")` on `rg --json`  | ripgrep JSON emits begin, match, context, end, and summary message types           |
| Using `curl` with verbose flag syntax                 | Use `xh` which provides colorized output and HTTPie-compatible request-item syntax |
| Parsing text output between tools with `cut`/`tr`     | Use Nushell pipelines that preserve structured data through every stage            |
| Anchoring regex with `.*` at the start                | Anchor with `^` when possible; unanchored `.*` causes expensive backtracking       |

## Installation

All tools are available via common package managers. Most are single statically linked binaries.

| Nushell | `brew install nushell` | `cargo install nu`                               |

Shell integration (add to shell config after installing):

| Tool   | Shell Integration Required                                |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| zoxide | `eval "$(zoxide init zsh)"` (or bash/fish equivalent)     |
| fzf    | Source keybinding and completion scripts from fzf install |

## Delegation

- **Large-scale codebase search and analysis**: Use `Explore` agent to run ripgrep queries, trace dependencies, and map code patterns
- **Multi-file refactoring workflows**: Use `Task` agent to coordinate fd, sed, and verification steps across an entire project
- **Pipeline architecture for data transformation**: Use `Plan` agent to design structured pipelines combining jq, Nushell, and API tools

## Maintenance Schedule

| Frequency | Tasks                                                                             |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Daily     | Monitor errors, review user feedback, address urgent corrections                  |
| Weekly    | Review new submissions, update time-sensitive knowledge, run quality checks       |
| Monthly   | Audit freshness, resolve conflicts, analyze usage, update stale content           |
| Quarterly | Comprehensive quality audit, schema review, performance optimization, user survey |

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Role             | Responsibility                                  |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Knowledge owners | Domain experts responsible for content accuracy |
| Curators         | Review and approve changes                      |
| Contributors     | Submit new knowledge                            |
| Consumers        | Use knowledge and provide feedback              |

## Change Process

Submit → Review → Approve → Publish → Monitor
```

## Quality Standards

- Minimum source quality requirements
- Citation requirements for all factual claims
- Update frequency requirements per content type
- Conflict resolution process when sources disagree

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall                     | Impact                  | Solution                                        |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Build it and they will come | Doesn't meet user needs | Start with user research, validate continuously |
| Perfectionism               | Never launches          | Launch at 80% coverage, iterate on usage        |
| Over-engineering            | Wasted complexity       | Start simple, add complexity only when needed   |
| Maintenance neglect         | Knowledge rot           | Establish maintenance schedule from day 1       |
| No provenance               | Can't verify accuracy   | Always track source + timestamp + author        |
| Data dump without curation  | Low signal-to-noise     | Curate before ingesting, quality > quantity     |
